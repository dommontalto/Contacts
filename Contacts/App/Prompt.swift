*** PROBLEM STATEMENT ***

Design and implement a simple Contacts App using SwiftUI that provides basic
functionality similar to the native iPhone Contacts app.

Requirements:

Contact Data:
– First name
– Last name
– Email

View Contacts:
– Display a vertically scrollable list of contacts.
– Display contact initials in a circular view for each contact
– Next to the initials view, display contact first name, last name and email (See UI)

Add a Contact:
– Provide a screen where users can add new contacts by entering a first name, last name and email.

Edit a Contact:
– Allow users to edit an existing contact’s details.
– Enable save button only if changes have been made to contact (Bonus)
– If changes have been made and user tries to exit, show an alert confirmation warning (Bonus)

Search for contacts:
– Add a search bar to filter contacts
– Search should be on user's name or email

Delete a Contact:
– Add deletion button on contact detail screen
– Add confirmation alert for contact deletion in edit screen (Bonus)
– Swipe to delete (Bonus feature)

Navigation Logic:
– Add contact should be a modal sheet
– Edit contact should be a navigation push to a contact detail screen

The contact list should persist for the session (no need for long-term storage like Core Data).

Follow-Up Questions:
1. How would you persist the contact list between app sessions?
2. Should we use a remote database for this application?
3. How would you handle large lists of contacts for performance?
